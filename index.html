                        <h2>Biography of Johnathan Hong:</h2>
                        <em>As recounted by Nick Peterson. Every part of this is true and verified by Mr. Hong.</em>
                        <h4>Early Life</h4>
                        <p>Mr. Hong was born in 2001 in California. A few years later, he was kicked off the island of Jeju for biting a glass.</p>
                        <p>Not much is known about Mr. Hong's early life. He lived in Korea for much of his life with his brother Dr. Jason Wu and their mysterious family. A few baby pictures exist of him and Jason, but we do not have access to them.</p>
                        <h4>Johnathan Grows Older</h4>
                        <p>Mr. Hong and Dr. Wu grew older together, in a happy home with their sister and parents.
                       </p>
                        <p>Mr. Hong and his brother grew up in a household that valued academia.</p>
                        <p>In a 2015 interview, Mr. Hong and his brother described their lives.</p>
                        <p><em style="font-size:100%">"We went to school for 6 hours, then went to the academy for 6 more, then spent the rest of the night studying."</em></p>
                        <p>All the hard work paid off when John and Jason came to Northampton, where the academic standards were not as intense as they were in Korea.</p>
                        <p>And to this very day, they are at the very top of the class. Mr. Hong has come to focus on taking over the school through social influence, while Dr. Wu has kept his grades incredibly high. Both stress the importance of the 4.0 as it relates to collegiate, graduate-level, and career success.</p>
                        <h4>Mr. Hong's Love of Squash</h4>
                        <p>Johnathan loves the sport of squash. In fact, many pictures that have been taken of him are of him playing squash. He is known to go to Smith to play squash during his free period!</p>
                        <h4>What lies in store for Johnathan?</h4>
                        <p>It is not a doubt that Mr. Hong will find great success in his life. But what exactly will he do?</p>
                        <p>Is his goal in life to make money? Find great happiness and fulfillment? Both?</p>
